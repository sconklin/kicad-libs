Apparently by SGI, it will convert VRML 1.0 to VRML 2.0. The executable, part of Cosmo Player, 
was a Windows command line program called vrml1tovrml2.exe and required a dynamic linked library 
called cp_vrml1to2.dll. The program is now distributed about the web as this pair of files. 
Unzip the two files, which must remain together, into a directory which is in your path.
